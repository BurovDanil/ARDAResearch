		%history%
		From the 1970s, Command Line System (CLI) enables users to input commands for executing computers tasks. As technology progressed, graphical user interfaces (GUI) like Xerox Alto (Xerox - 1973) and the first Macintosh (Apple - 1984) became the mainstream choice. GUIs are the primary interface for most users because of the user-friendly experience, relegating CLI only to experienced users.\\
		%cite -> wikipedia% 
		
		%topic introdutction%
		
		This research mainly focuses on evaluating whether the CLI is more efficient and faster to use on a practical level compared to the GUI. In order to evaluate this an experiment and a survey were conducted. Since the target group was IT students, Git was used as an evaluation tool.\\
		
		%data evaluation%
		The results show that using the CLI instead of using the GUI for executing basic Git commands is faster and more efficient.   After getting to know the CLI commands the average pace of executing them increased significantly, showing how using the CLI can be more effective overtime. Moreover,some people who had never used the CLI before, showed interest in using it for personal usage.
